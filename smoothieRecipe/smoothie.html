    <h1> Raspberry Blackberry Smoothie Recipe</h1>

    <h4> <em> I followed the recipe exactly. It was very tasty and easy to make. However, you need to strain it before drinking, as the blackberry seeds are impossible to ignore. Next time I'll substitute something else for the blackberries.</em></h4>
    <h4> <em> Excellent. I used greek yogurt because that was all I had on hand. Made one batch, then turned around and made another because my kids and I loved it so much. Great use of this year's bumper crop of blackberries/raspberries.</em></h4>
