    <ul>
        <li> 3 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li> 1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup chopped carrots</li>
        <li> 2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li> 2 and 1/2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li> 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup strong brewed coffee</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup water</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> STEPS ON HOW TO MAKE THE DISH </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li> Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li>
